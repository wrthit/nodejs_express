# nodejs_express
a node.js, express with mongo and bootstrap starter

This is code created by following https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-9FEtEKITzL2Du2M64Yx2d6oCUVmhR56. However, bower was not used due to deprecation. I need to figure out how webpack works and inject bootstrap and jquery properly to complete this tutorial.
